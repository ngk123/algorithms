-> next prime (look at bartrand postulate)

-> fibonnaci with matrix method
	(Problem reduced to square of fibonacci number for input n)
	
-> do inversion count (with lower bound as weel as segment tree)

-> Nim Game

-> http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/
	
	with some modification that we can perform one flip operation on array.
	we may select any number of contiguous element from given array for flip operation.
	Such that sum of element of array should be maximum.
	NOTE: flip operation will invert sign of all contiguous element

-> given preorder, inorder, calculate postorder..

-> N clothes each of a given length and hanging on a rope at position i, calculate number of clothes finally visible..
Example: (2,4) (1,3) (3,5) : output is 2 2nd and 3rd cloth will be visible..
s
-> A number x is mapped to 'x + (number of 1 bits in x)'
Calculate from the given array, the count of numbers which can't be mapped in this way..
For example: 3 is mapped to 5, 2 is mapped to 3..
So, 5 and 3 can be mapped by some number.. But 4 can't be mapped.

-> given a sentence reverse each word and get the first letter of the reversed word to be capital if it is a letter otherwise let it be as it is.

->First question boiled down to finding sum of all numbers in the nth row of the Pascal's triangle (2 ^ n).

->You are given a large cake, you can make n (<= 10 ^ 9) vertical cuts, what is the maximum number of pieces you can make modulo 10^9 + 7. (You can double the number of pieces in each cut by stacking the pieces upon each other and then making a cut. So answer is 2 ^ n modulo 10^9+7). Both the questions had the same answer! Only difference: n was small enough for a one line solution in the first question.

->given array of integers and sum, find in how many ways you can select subset of array whose sum is given sum.

->given array of 10^6 positions, initially 0, perform queries. Query is to increment given position by 1. Each query was followed by some start and end positions, give sum of sub-array for each query.


-> The Pizzeria Problem
One pizza delivery boy has to serve "n" number of customers. He can serve one pizza at a time. Each customers pizza receiving time, and time taken to come back to the pizzeria are given. You have to find out maximum number of possible pizza deliveries.
Note :TIme taken by the delivery boy to customer is negligible

Input:
N : Number of customers
a[N] : Pizza receiving time
b[N] : Time needed to come back to pizzeria after delivering to ith customer
Output:
Maximum Number of orders that can be fulfilled using the scheduling you made

Ex :
Input : 5 {3 6 1 4 7} {5 8 4 7 10}
output: 3 (Explanation : a[2]->a[3]->a[4])

-> Jack Sparrow's escape from Jail
Input :
Four arguments
(climbUp, climbDown, noWalls, wallHeights[])
climbUp : number of meters he can jump (1 <= climbUp <= 10^4)
climbDown: number of meters he slides down (1 <= climbUp <= 10^4)
noWalls : number of walls he needs to jump to escape (1 <= noWalls <= 10^4)
wallHeights[] : 1-D array containing height of each wall(1 <= height <= 10^3)
Output :
Total number of jumps to output variable output1

Ex :
Input: 5:1:2:{9,10}
Here Jack Sparrow can jump height of 5 meters, but slides down by 1 meter. He has 2 walls to jump and the height of each wall is 9 and 10 meteres, resp. For 1st wall he needs two attempts(5m up-> 1m down-> 5m up) to cross it. In the same way he needs 3 attempts to cross 2nd wall. SO total 5 attempt.



ML  & Hadoop:

2 questions out of 6....
1) What is the default inputFormat for MapReduce system ?
a. FileInputFormat
b. TextInputFormat
c. SequenceFileFormat
d. BinaryFileFormat

2) For a given feature, you have the following values: (5,8,9,2). You plan to use both min-max normalization (dividing by max-min) and mean normalization. What would be the normalized value of feature value 5 ? 
Some more coding questions:
a. 0.12 b. 5.29 c. 0.33 d. -0.33

1. Default input format: Ans. TextInputFormat
2. Probability question based on Bayes Theorem
3. What happens in a regression algorithm if the threshold is decreased. (what happens to recall and precision)
4. Some questions on return type of certain functions
5. Classification problem(experience, task, learning algorithm)
6. reducer = 0?



Infrastucture:

1. What does amazon aws service provides? 
2. What is failing securely? I do not remember all of them but they are quite intuitive and you have to guess the answer out of 4 options


Network  & OS:

Read Data Link Layer, IP class basics
What is ARP protocol? 
Ethernet header contains which fields? 
What is swapping?
What happens in thrashing? 
Question on yield and synchronization,

OS: Linux commands, Memory Management, disk management, context switch.

Networking: Basically ARP, different message types in different layers, N/W topology,Ethernet header, etc.


Programming questions were based on Java. 
1. try, catch, finally
2. error in given function etc
3. Threads based questions
4. Polymorphism 
5. Access modifiers

Application security hovered around RSA, DLP (key exchange), MAC security, semantic and deterministic encryption, securely failing, positive security models.
